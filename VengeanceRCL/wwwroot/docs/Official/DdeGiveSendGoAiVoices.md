## Viral Expose Video Script Adapting

Most AI voice platforms are built for linear scripts — not full scene-by-scene storyboards with embedded actions, sound cues, or emotional notes.

### 🔧 Here's how we fix this in two directions:

---

### ✅ Option 1: **Adapt the Script Format for AI Voice Tools**

AI voice tools (like ElevenLabs, PlayHT, Murf.ai, or Descript) *do* best with straightforward narration lines — no embedded visual/audio directions.

**Let’s make a dedicated “narration-only” version** of your script:

---

#### 📄 Narration-Only Sample Format (AI Friendly):

```plaintext
[Scene 1 - Tone: Urgent, Grave]
Breaking News out of Brockton, Massachusetts. A judge has defied a federal court-imposed automatic stay — effectively rendering a 76-year-old deaf and disabled woman homeless.

[Scene 2 - Tone: Insistent, Outraged]
Legal technicalities can overturn even the toughest cases. So why were a dozen infractions overlooked in this one?
```

**💡 What works best for AI voices:**

* Keep directions **outside the line**, using **\[brackets]** for tone, pauses, etc.
* Use simple cues like:

  * `[Tone: somber]`
  * `[Pause 2s]`
  * `[Emphasize: "defied"]`
* Avoid embedding things like: `(camera zooms)` or `(show footage)` — that’s for you in Shotcut, not the AI narrator.

---

### ✅ Option 2: **Use Platforms That Support Multitrack + AI Narration**

Some tools **accept scene-style formats** and let you *manually assign voice tone, background audio, and pacing*. Here are a few strong ones:

### 🎙️ Best AI Voice Tools for Multi-Tone Scripts:

| Tool              | Strengths                                                                     | Link                                                         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **ElevenLabs**    | Ultra realistic, supports SSML-like input for tone/pauses. API usable too.    | [https://www.elevenlabs.io](https://www.elevenlabs.io)       |
| **Murf.ai**       | Designed for full voiceover projects with music, timelines, and multi-tone.   | [https://www.murf.ai](https://www.murf.ai)                   |
| **Descript**      | Great for video projects. Lets you use AI voices + edit scenes directly.      | [https://www.descript.com](https://www.descript.com)         |
| **WellSaid Labs** | Extremely professional voice quality. Can manage tone via sentence splitting. | [https://www.wellsaidlabs.com](https://www.wellsaidlabs.com) |
| **PlayHT**        | Natural AI voices with emotion. Supports some SSML.                           | [https://play.ht](https://play.ht)                           |

## 🧠 Bonus: Want to Hand AI the Perfect Voice Script?

I’ll take your full storyboard and auto-generate a **clean “Narrator Voice Script”** from it — stripped of visual cues and formatted in the tone AI likes. I’ll even annotate each line with emotion tags like:

```plaintext
[Tone: Grave]
Breaking News out of Brockton, Massachusetts...

[Tone: Sympathetic]
Caught in the chaos was Mrs. Hall, 76, deaf and disabled...
```

That script can be:

* Dropped into **any AI voice tool** for immediate testing
* Used as a **subtitle track**
* Synced with **video/audio editing** inside Shotcut or DaVinci



[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)


---

## Voice Maps:

* Each **narrator block** is separated.
* Each **tone** is tied to the scene (not to the narrator label).
* This is copy/paste ready for **ElevenLabs**, with voice-switching control if needed per segment.


| Use Case                                   | What to Use                                                                 |
|: ------------------------------------------ |: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Manual use in ElevenLabs Studio**        | ✅ Keep `Narrator 1:` style. You pick the voice per scene or paste           |
| **Multi-voice project / automation / API** | ✅ Use `[Voice: Liam]` and `[Voice:Hope – upbeat and clear]`                                  |
| **Documenting actor roles**                | ✅ Use `Narrator 1:`, but *also include* a voice map at the top for clarity: |

**For Example**:

```markdown
# 🎙️ Voice Map
Narrator 1: (News Anchor) → [Voice:Liam]
Narrator 2: (Field Reporter) → [Voice:Hope – upbeat and clear]
Narrator 3: (Firsthand Witness Advocate) → [Voice:Jason]
Narrator 4: (Spuds) → [Voice:Grandpa Spuds Oxley]
Narrator 5: (Judge) → [Voice:Rachel]
```

This solves confusion **without polluting each script line**.

We’ll also preserve the **broadcast realism** and **documentary depth** by using:


### 🎤 **Narrator 1: (News Anchor)** → \[Voice:Liam]

* Voice of structure, formality, and escalation
* Anchors the flow — introduces field reports, hands off scenes, and delivers act breaks
* Tone: authoritative, composed, urgent when needed

### 🎤 **Narrator 2: (Field Reporter)**  → \[Voice:Hope – upbeat and clear]

* Voice of context and unfolding emotion on location
* Brings urgency and witness commentary *from the ground*
* Think: “outside courthouse,” “as the public reacts,” “while officials refuse to comment”
* Tone: engaged, human, professionally shaken, upbeat & clear

### 🎥 **Narrator 3:  (Witness Advocate)** → \[Voice:Jason]

* Seen and/or heard
* The heart of the story. You are *the living proof* that this happened
* Enters with voice or video only when it matters most: *awakening moments, breakdowns, revelations, personal reflections*
* Tone: honest, reflective, protective, strong


### 🎥 **Narrator 4:  (Spuds)** → \[Voice:Grandpa Spuds Oxley]

* Heard
* The old timer, final boss. 
* Enters with voice only when it matters most: *awakening moments, breakdowns, revelations, resolve*
* Tone: honest, reflective, protective, strong
 
### 🎤 **Narrator 5: (Judge)**  → \[Voice:Rachel]

* Voice of context and defensive emotion on location
* Brings urgency and witness commentary *from the ground*
* Think: “outside courthouse,” “as the public reacts,” “while officials refuse to comment”
* Tone: engaged, human, professionally shaken, upbeat & clear

## ✅ Summary of Format Locked In:

| Feature                   | Format                                 |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Scene tone                | `[Scene 1 – Tone: Urgent, Grave]`      |
| Narrator cue              | `Narrator 2:` on its own line          |
| Mid-scene tone shift      | `[Tone Shift: X → Y]` above line block |
| Voice map                 | Listed once at the top                 |
| No inline `[Voice: Name]` | ✅ Cleaner, easier in ElevenLabs Studio |

[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

---

## ✅ Summary of Format Special Cases:

What you’re seeing in the top of the ElevenLabs UI:

> ✅ `Hope – upbeat and clear`

...is the **globally selected voice profile** (either custom or preset), and it **overrides everything unless you switch scenes manually or create a multi-voice project.**

[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

---



## 🔍 So what does this mean practically?

### ✅ 1. That voice selection **at the top** is your **"active narrator"**

* No matter how perfectly your `[Voice: Liam]` tags are written, **ElevenLabs Studio Text-to-Speech mode** will still only use the *active voice* unless you're doing one of the following:

  * Multi-voice **Scene Project Mode**
  * API-controlled text-to-voice automation
  * Manual voice-swapping between copy/pastes

[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

---

### ✅ 2. You must still **manually switch the voice in the sidebar**

...if you're using ElevenLabs Studio and working scene-by-scene.

This is what I recommend:

> 💡 **Use `[Voice: Liam]` and `Narrator 1:` in your scripts** for clear documentation and future multi-voice use — but you’ll still need to:
>
> * Select *Liam* before pasting Liam’s part
> * Select *Hope – upbeat and clear* before pasting Hope’s part
> * etc.

That top bar just lets ElevenLabs *know what mood/voice is running the current generation.*

[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

---

### ✅ 3. You’re using the best possible system

Even though ElevenLabs doesn’t parse `Voice: Liam` directly in Studio TTS right now, it’s still **hugely useful** because:

* 📄 You’ll know **exactly which parts** to assign to each voice
* ✅ You’re **future-proofing** the script for:

  * Studio's multi-voice timeline editor (in beta)
  * External projects (Descript, Final Cut, Premiere, etc.)
  * Collaboration with anyone else (narrators, editors)

[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

### 📦 4. Final Summary

| Context                         | What You Do                                                           |
|: ------------------------------- |: --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Studio (TTS)**                | Manually select voice in sidebar before pasting each narrator’s lines |
| **Script Format**               | ✅ Keep `[Voice: Liam]`, `Narrator 1:`, tone markers for organization  |
| **Multi-Voice Future Projects** | You’re already formatted correctly                                    |
| **Voice label at top**          | Visual cue only — doesn’t dynamically change voices mid-script        |

## Scene Elements Setup

Each scene should be visually engaging, with a mix of real footage, reenactments, and graphics. The tone is urgent and serious, reflecting the gravity of the situation while maintaining journalistic integrity.

| Element                                                        | Recommendation                                                                                                |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------- |: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Visual**                                                     | Use something like, **“Breaking News”** graphic flashes on screen, overlaying an aerial view of Brockton, Massachusetts at dusk. |
| **Audio**                                                     | **SFX:** Urgent **breaking news alert** chime, **Background:** Tense news theme music., etc. |
| **Narrator**                                                     | Use `Narrator 1` → `[Voice:Liam]`, `Narrator 2` → `[Voice:Hope – upbeat and clear]`, `Narrator 3` → `[Voice:Jason]`, `Narrator 4` → `[Voice:Grandpa Spuds Oxley]`, `Narrator 5` → `[Voice:Rachel]`                                      |
| **Lower Thirds**                                               | Update to match speakers: e.g., *Narrator 2: “LIVE: Outside Condemned Home”*                                  |
| **News Ticker**                                                | Keep it consistent unless you have a reason to update (e.g., to quote a public statement or mention timeline) |
| **Transitions/Effects**                                          | For example, the scene begins by cutting from the footage to a two-up shot of anchor and guest. A quick animated lower-third banner slides in with “Live Interview”.                                                    |

## Scene 1: Breaking News Introduction

### **Visual:** 

A **“Breaking News”** graphic flashes on screen, overlaying an aerial view of Brockton, Massachusetts at dusk. A news anchor-style lower-third reads: *“Judge Defies Federal Stay – Elderly Disabled Woman Homeless.”*

###  **Audio:**  

**SFX:** Urgent **breaking news alert** chime.  
**Background:** Tense news theme music.

### **Lower Third:** 

Judge Defies Federal Stay – Elderly Disabled Woman Homeless  

### **News Ticker:** 
Follow the story at www.givesendgo.com/dde

### **Narrator**:

**Narrator 1 (urgent, grave):**  
*“Breaking News out of Brockton, Massachusetts.  
A judge has defied a federal court-imposed automatic stay — under Eleven U.S. Code, Section 362 — effectively rendering a seventy-six-year-old deaf and disabled woman homeless.”*  
*A seven-year legal battle has led to a wrongful home condemnation.  

*She’s been forcibly removed from the only home she’s known for over fifty years.”*

**Narrator 1 (urgent, grave):** *"The shocking allegations are gaining traction across the state."*  

*"For more, we go live to our team on the ground. Narrator 2?"*

**Narrator 2:**

Thanks, Narrator 1.  
We’re just outside the Brockton District Courthouse where today’s proceedings are being described by observers as nothing short of surreal.

[Tone Shift: Somber → Emotional]


**Narrator 2:** 

One woman. Deaf. Elderly. Alone.  
And according to court filings, forcibly removed from her home — without warning, and without representation.  
What played out here today has left many asking,  
“How could this happen in America?”

**AI Script Version**: `Voice: Hope`

**Narrator 2:**

But as we’d soon learn… the story doesn’t end at the courthouse steps.  
It’s just beginning.

**Editorial Note:** Only slight punctuation tweaks for flow.

## Scene 2: Legal Irregularities Exposed

### **Visual:** 

A **courtroom gavel slams** in slow motion, then freeze-frames. Text on screen: “Multiple Legal Infractions Overlooked?”.

### **Audio:**

**SFX:** Gavel slam reverb.  
**Background:** Continue tense music.

### **Lower Third:** 

Systemic Violations Go Unpunished  

### **News Ticker:** 

Follow the story at www.givesendgo.com/dde

### **Narrator:** 

**Narrator 2 (insistent):**  
*“Legal technicalities can overturn even the toughest cases – a **single misstep** can get a murder trial thrown out. **So why were a dozen infractions overlooked in this case?** Despite numerous violations and red flags, **the Hall family’s fight still drags on**. Why? The answer, it seems, is unsettling.”*

**Narrator 2 (lower, ominous):**  
*“Because **someone is cheating the system**,”* he continues, voice dropping gravely. *“And when cheating goes unchecked, it **destroys families, memories, and livelihoods**.”*

**Editorial Note:** Combined split lines for smoother narration in AI voice delivery.

## Scene 3: Not a Typical Foreclosure – Meet the Hall Family

### **Visual:** 

A **photo of Scott Hall** fades in beside a **document stack** and **HIPAA compliance seal** graphic. Possible overlay: **“Healthcare IT Professional”** or **“6-Figure Compliance Manager”**.

### **Audio:**

**Background:** Tense music softens slightly for exposition.

### **Lower Third:** 

Meet Scott Hall – Son, Advocate, Professional  

### **News Ticker:** 

Follow the story at www.givesendgo.com/dde

### **Narrator:** 

**Narrator 1 (matter-of-fact, urgent):**  
*“This wasn’t some routine foreclosure gone wrong – **it was far from textbook**. At the center is **Mrs. Hall’s son, Scott Hall**, who took up the fight to save their home. Scott is **no deadbeat homeowner**; he’s a **well-educated professional** who managed six-figure healthcare IT projects handling sensitive patient data.”*

*“After his father’s death, Scott **poured thousands of dollars** into catching up the mortgage and legal fees, following every procedure **to the letter**. His impeccable record and unwavering compliance should have protected them – **he did everything right** – yet that’s exactly why, he says, **corrupt officials resorted to dirty tricks to undermine him**.”*

**Editorial Note:** Tightened some spacing and added emphasis on Scott's background for clarity.

### **Narrator:** 

**Narrator 2 (somber, sympathetic):** 

*“Caught in this chaos is **Mrs. Hall** herself. In the midst of the dispute, authorities invoked a **rare “Section 12” mental health hold** – an emergency commitment usually reserved for the most dire cases.”*

*“**Without warning, officers removed Mrs. Hall from her home** and **involuntarily sectioned** her for psychiatric evaluation. **No interpreter was provided.** She was effectively silenced – unable to communicate as she was held for days.”*

*“This **denial of an ASL interpreter** not only violated her rights – it **delayed critical medical care and legal counsel** when she needed them most.”*

**Editorial Note:** Clarified language to reinforce the legal implications of denial of interpreter.

### **Narrator:** 

**Narrator 2(grave, outraged):**  
*“If that wasn’t enough, Brockton’s officials moved in on the Hall home itself. **Without any hearing or warning**, city inspectors **plastered the house with ominous red X’s** – like a **death mark** – declaring it ‘unsafe’.”*

*“Their justification? **Falsified reports.** No due process. No chance for the Halls to respond. In one swift blow, the family home of 50 years was **condemned by decree**.”*

*“Neighbors watched in shock as the Hall residence was sealed shut based on what appear to be **bogus claims**.”*

## Prompting Eleven v3 (alpha)

> Learn how to prompt and use audio tags with our most advanced model.

This guide provides the most effective tags and techniques for prompting Eleven v3, including voice selection, changes in capitalization, punctuation, audio tags and multi-speaker dialogue. Experiment with these methods to discover what works best for your specific voice and use case.

Eleven v3 is in alpha. Very short prompts are more likely to cause inconsistent outputs. We encourage you to experiment with prompts greater than 250 characters.


[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

---

## Voice Selection

The most important parameter for Eleven v3 is the voice you choose. It needs to be similar enough to the desired delivery. For example, if the voice is shouting and you use the audio tag `[whispering]`, it likely won't work well.

When creating IVCs, you should include a broader emotional range than before. As a result, voices in the voice library may produce more variable results compared to the v2 and v2.5 models. We've compiled over 22 [excellent voices for V3 here](https://elevenlabs.io/app/voice-library/collections/aF6JALq9R6tXwCczjhKH).

Choose voices strategically based on your intended use:

---

### Emotionally Diverse

For expressive IVC voices, vary emotional tones across the recording—include both neutral and
dynamic samples.

---

### Targeted Niche

For specific use cases like sports commentary, maintain consistent emotion throughout the
dataset.

---

### Neutral

Neutral voices tend to be more stable across languages and styles, providing reliable baseline
performance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Professional Voice Clones (PVCs) are currently not fully optimized for Eleven v3, resulting in potentially lower clone quality compared to earlier models. During this research preview stage it would be best to find an Instant Voice Clone (IVC) or designed voice for your project if you need to use v3 features.

---

## Settings

Eleven v3 introduces new settings that significantly affect voice output. The most important is the **stability** slider, which controls how closely the generated voice adheres to the original reference audio.

### Stability

The stability slider is the most important setting in v3, controlling how closely the generated voice adheres to the original reference audio.

---

### Stability Settings in Eleven

* **Creative:** More emotional and expressive, but prone to hallucinations.
* **Natural:** Closest to the original voice recording—balanced and neutral.
* **Robust:** Highly stable, but less responsive to directional prompts but consistent, similar to v2.

> [!NOTE]
> For maximum expressiveness with audio tags, use Creative or Natural settings. Robust reduces responsiveness to directional prompts.
>


[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

---

## Audio Tags

Eleven v3 introduces emotional control through audio tags. You can direct voices to laugh, whisper, act sarcastic, or express curiosity among many other styles. Speed is also controlled through audio tags.

> [!NOTE]
> The voice you choose and its training samples will affect tag effectiveness. Some tags work well with certain voices while others may not. Don't expect a whispering voice to suddenly shout with a `[shout]` tag.
>

---

### Voice-Related

These tags control vocal delivery and emotional expression:

* `[laughs]`, `[laughs harder]`, `[starts laughing]`, `[wheezing]`
* `[whispers]`
* `[sighs]`, `[exhales]`
* `[sarcastic]`, `[curious]`, `[excited]`, `[crying]`, `[snorts]`, `[mischievously]`

```plaintext Example
[whispers] I never knew it could be this way, but I'm glad we're here.
```

---

### Sound Effects

Add environmental sounds and effects:

* `[gunshot]`, `[applause]`, `[clapping]`, `[explosion]`
* `[swallows]`, `[gulps]`

```plaintext Example
[applause] Thank you all for coming tonight! [gunshot] What was that?
```

---

### Unique and Special

Experimental tags for creative applications:

* `[strong X accent]` (replace X with desired accent)
* `[sings]`, `[woo]`, `[fart]`

```plaintext Example
[strong French accent] "Zat's life, my friend — you can't control everysing."
```

> [!WARNING]
> Some experimental tags may be less consistent across different voices. Test thoroughly before production use.
>

---

## Punctuation

Punctuation significantly affects delivery in v3:

* **Ellipses (...)** add pauses and weight
* **Capitalization** increases emphasis
* **Standard punctuation** provides natural speech rhythm

```plaintext Example
"It was a VERY long day [sigh] ... nobody listens anymore."
```


[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

---

## Single Speaker Examples

Use tags intentionally and match them to the voice's character. A meditative voice shouldn't shout; a hyped voice won't whisper convincingly.

### Expressive Monologue

```plaintext
"Okay, you are NOT going to believe this.

You know how I've been totally stuck on that short story?

Like, staring at the screen for HOURS, just... nothing?

[frustrated sigh] I was seriously about to just trash the whole thing. Start over.

Give up, probably. But then!

Last night, I was just doodling, not even thinking about it, right?

And this one little phrase popped into my head. Just... completely out of the blue.

And it wasn't even for the story, initially.

But then I typed it out, just to see. And it was like... the FLOODGATES opened!

Suddenly, I knew exactly where the character needed to go, what the ending had to be...

It all just CLICKED. [happy gasp] I stayed up till, like, 3 AM, just typing like a maniac.

Didn't even stop for coffee! [laughs] And it's... it's GOOD! Like, really good.

It feels so... complete now, you know? Like it finally has a soul.

I am so incredibly PUMPED to finish editing it now.

It went from feeling like a chore to feeling like... MAGIC. Seriously, I'm still buzzing!"
```

### Dynamic and Humorous

```plaintext
[laughs] Alright...guys - guys. Seriously.

[exhales] Can you believe just how - realistic - this sounds now?

[laughing hysterically] I mean OH MY GOD...it's so good.

Like you could never do this with the old model.

For example [pauses] could you switch my accent in the old model?

[dismissive] didn't think so. [excited] but you can now!

Check this out... [cute] I'm going to speak with a french accent now..and between you and me

[whispers] I don't know how. [happy] ok.. here goes. [strong French accent] "Zat's life, my friend — you can't control everysing."

[giggles] isn't that insane? Watch, now I'll do a Russian accent -

[strong Russian accent] "Dee Goldeneye eez fully operational and rready for launch."

[sighs] Absolutely, insane! Isn't it..? [sarcastic] I also have some party tricks up my sleeve..

I mean i DID go to music school.

[singing quickly] "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy BIRTHDAY dear ElevenLabs... Happy birthday to youuu."

### Customer Service Simulation

```plaintext
[professional] "Thank you for calling Tech Solutions. My name is Sarah, how can I help you today?"

[sympathetic] "Oh no, I'm really sorry to hear you're having trouble with your new device. That sounds frustrating."

[questioning] "Okay, could you tell me a little more about what you're seeing on the screen?"

[reassuring] "Alright, based on what you're describing, it sounds like a software glitch. We can definitely walk through some troubleshooting steps to try and fix that."

## Multi-speaker Dialogue

v3 can handle multi-voice prompts effectively. Assign distinct voices from your Voice Library for each speaker to create realistic conversations.

### Dialogue Showcase

```plaintext
Narrator 1: [excitedly] Sam! Have you tried the new Eleven V3?

Narrator 2: [curiously] Just got it! The clarity is amazing. I can actually do whispers now—
[whispers] like this!

Narrator 1: [impressed] Ooh, fancy! Check this out—
[dramatically] I can do full Shakespeare now! "To be or not to be, that is the question!"

Narrator 2: [giggling] Nice! Though I'm more excited about the laugh upgrade. Listen to this—
[with genuine belly laugh] Ha ha ha!

Narrator 1: [delighted] That's so much better than our old "ha. ha. ha." robot chuckle!

Narrator 2: [amazed] Wow! V2 me could never. I'm actually excited to have conversations now instead of just... talking at people.

Narrator 1: [warmly] Same here! It's like we finally got our personality software fully installed.
```

### Comedy and Timing

```plaintext
Narrator 1: [nervously] So... I may have tried to debug myself while running a text-to-speech generation.

Narrator 2: [alarmed] One, no! That's like performing surgery on yourself!

Narrator 1: [sheepishly] I thought I could multitask! Now my voice keeps glitching mid-sen—
[robotic voice] TENCE.

Narrator 2: [stifling laughter] Oh wow, you really broke yourself.

Narrator 1: [frustrated] It gets worse! Every time someone asks a question, I respond in—
[binary beeping] 010010001!

Narrator 2: [cracking up] You're speaking in binary! That's actually impressive!

Narrator 1: [desperately] Two, this isn't funny! I have a presentation in an hour and I sound like a dial-up modem!

Narrator 2: [giggling] Have you tried turning yourself off and on again?

Narrator 1: [deadpan] Very funny.
[pause, then normally] Wait... that actually worked.
```

### Overlapping Timing

```plaintext
Narrator 1: [starting to speak] So I was thinking we could—

Narrator 2: [jumping in] —test our new timing features?

Narrator 1: [surprised] Exactly! How did you—

Narrator 2: [overlapping] —know what you were thinking? Lucky guess!

Narrator 1: [pause] Sorry, go ahead.

Narrator 2: [cautiously] Okay, so if we both try to talk at the same time—

Narrator 1: [overlapping] —we'll probably crash the system!

Narrator 2: [panicking] Wait, are we crashing? I can't tell if this is a feature or a—

Narrator 1: [interrupting, then stopping abruptly] Bug! ...Did I just cut you off again?

Narrator 2: [sighing] Yes, but honestly? This is kind of fun.

Narrator 1: [mischievously] Race you to the next sentence!

Narrator 2: [laughing] We're definitely going to break something!

## 💡 Tips

### Tag Combinations

You can combine multiple audio tags for complex emotional delivery. Experiment with different combinations to find what works best for your voice.

---

### Voice Matching

Match tags to your voice's character and training data. A serious, professional voice may not respond well to playful tags like `[giggles]` or `[mischievously]`.

---

### Text Structure

Text structure strongly influences output with v3. Use natural speech patterns, properpunctuation, and clear emotional context for best results.

---

### Experimentation

There are likely many more effective tags beyond this list. Experiment with descriptive emotional states and actions to discover what works for your specific use case.

## ✅ Final Suggestion:

Let’s agree on this general rule:

> ✳️ **If the transition is under 30 seconds, keep it in one scene.**
> ✳️ **If the new voice carries significant new content, emotion, or length → new scene.**

You can also include `Narrator 3` later if the witness appears — we’ll treat them like a **"Guest Expert" or Firsthand Voice"**.

---

## ✅ Final Suggestion After Testing:

I caught some issues when testing what **worked best previously** in ElevenLabs:
* 🎙️ **Narrator-level tone** (e.g., *Narrator 1 – urgent, then neutral, then resolute*)
* 🎬 **Scene-level tone** (e.g., Scene starts grave, then softens or builds)

**ElevenLabs formatting** and its ability to detect `tone`, `character`, and `structure` is a bit sensitive.

---

## ✅ What's Next:

1. **Drop this script** into ElevenLabs, Murf, or any AI voice generator.
2. For best results:

   * Select an emotionally responsive voice (avoid robotic or “promo” tones).
   * Paste each scene block separately for better tone control.
   * Use “intonation preview” if available to test how each line sounds.
3. In **Shotcut**, you can now overlay this narration on your scene sequence.
4. Convert each scene into a `1:1` scene for [`DDE GiveSendGo – AI Narrator Voice Script`](../../Official/DdeGiveSendGoAiVoices.md) scene voiceovers.
