# Judge Renders 76 Yr Old Deaf Lady Homeless

Breaking News out of Brockton, Massachusetts at this hour! A seven-year legal battle leads to wrongful condemnation, a 76-year-old, deaf, and disabled woman sectioned, and now homeless, marks the latest scandal to rock the City of Champions storied streets.

It takes just one simple technicality to throw out even the harshest of murder cases. So why, after a dozen infractions overlooked in a far less serious—but equally terrifying—case, do we still see the Hall family’s fight continue?

Well, the path here is complicated. Conversely, the reason is simple: someone is cheating. And when cheating goes unchecked, it destroys families, memories, and livelihoods.

At first glance, this looked like a sad but textbook foreclosure battle—but it wasn’t. Scott Hall, Mrs. Hall's son, took on this battle. Scott isn’t an absentee homeowner or an uneducated bystander. He’s a well-educated professional who has held six-figure positions handling HIPAA-compliant patient data for local hospitals. Since his father’s death years ago, Scott has paid thousands upon thousands in legal fees and mortgages, following every process step to the letter, after a foreclosure on their home occurred while their focus was on the care for Scott's father. In fact, his impeccable record and unwavering dedication to do whatever possible within the confines of the law is why corrupt officials have resorted to dirty tactics just to overturn his efforts.

And make no mistake: this far exceeds even the treatment of your favorite “Maryland man” championed by politicians—because here, we have proof that those same political insiders are playing by two sets of rules. And how a 76-year-old, deaf, and disabled woman could even be rendered homeless in this country, for any reason—regardless of your political views—is extremely concerning.

## The Current Situation

### Immediate Housing Needed

Mrs. Hall faces a 5-year minimum wait for public housing—longer now, as resources are diverted to other priorities (including housing for illegal immigrants). She needs a safe, accessible home right away.

### Section 12 Detention

Local law enforcement invoked a rarely used “section 12” mental-health hold and denied Mrs. Hall her right to an interpreter—delaying critical medical care and legal counsel.

### Condemnation by Decree

Without warning or due process, city inspectors plastered the house with ominous “death marks” (spray-painted X’s), citing “unsafe structure” based on falsified reports.

### Family Under Siege

Scott was barred from visiting his mother; their pets were left without care. Every plea for interpreter services and every hearing request was systematically ignored.

### Corruption Exposed

We’ve compiled timelines, incident reports, documents, photos, and videos proving that the judge and lawyers who ruled against the Halls acted in bad faith. Building a case against them is now possible—but extremely costly.

## Why It Matters

### Disability Rights at Risk

Denying sign-language interpreters violates federal law and basic human dignity.

### Erosion of Due Process

Faked condemnation orders set a dangerous precedent: anyone can be silenced, dispossessed, and displaced without a fair hearing.

### Lack of Fundamental Resources

Massachusetts has only three court-system interpreters for the hearing-impaired—outrageously insufficient for our population.

### Community Outcry

Neighbors recall similar abuses in the 1990s—when our “City of Champions” nickname rang hollow for families targeted by insiders.

## How You Can Help NOW!

### Pray

This movement is grounded in spirit — your prayers are the foundation of hope, no matter what else you can offer.

### Donate

Every dollar funds:

+ Legal fees to overturn the bogus condemnation  
+ Secure housing for Mrs. Hall  
+ The multi-platform app and resources that will help the deaf, disabled, and elderly proactively fight injustice

Donate now if you can—any amount helps!

### Share

Amplify Scott’s story across social media so state and federal watchdogs can’t look away.

### Advocate

Sign our petition (coming soon) calling on the mayor’s office and district attorney to launch an independent investigation.

## Impact When They Succeed

### Home Restored & Justice Served

Mrs. Hall returns safely home; corrupt officials face strict penalties; new safeguards protect all disabled residents.

### Empowerment Through Technology

Launch of a cutting-edge mobile, desktop, and web application that equips the hearing-impaired (and their allies) with resources—and yes, some fun features—so no family endures this alone again.

> “I swore I’d never let them steal my mother’s dignity,” Scott says.  
> “With your help, we’ll stop the next wrongful eviction before it ever starts!”

## What's Next?

A lot has happened since the last court appearances on Wednesday, May 7, 2025. Because of these developments, we must keep the judge’s name, the latest evidence materials, and witness testimony confidential until further legal guidance. Once cleared, we will release explosive video and photo evidence supporting several of the more-than-a-dozen new allegations against the corrupt judge and associated parties. All this can happen as early as next week! 

**Stay tuned!**
