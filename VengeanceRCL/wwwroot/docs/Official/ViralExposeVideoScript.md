## Viral Expose Video Script

Below is the most recent script for the video that was created to promote the `DDE` campaign on `GiveSendGo.com/DDE`. It is a work in progress and will be updated as we continue to develop the content.

## ✅ TL;DR

**Keep it simple**: Scene tone first, narrator next, and let ElevenLabs handle the rest.

| Setting                | What Works Best                                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scene Tone             | `[Scene 1 – Tone: Urgent, Grave]`                       |
| Narrator Cue           | `Narrator 1:` (on a separate line)                      |
| Voice Matching         | Optional: ``Voice: Hope`` if you need future automation |
| Tone Changes Mid-Scene | `[Tone Shift: Grave → Hopeful]` (inline marker)         |


This format allows you to:

---

## Voice Maps:

* Each **narrator block** is separated.
* Each **tone** is tied to the scene (not to the narrator label).
* This is copy/paste ready for **ElevenLabs**, with voice-switching control if needed per segment.


| Use Case                                   | What to Use                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Manual use in ElevenLabs Studio**        | ✅ Keep `Narrator 1:` style. You pick the voice per scene or paste           |
| **Multi-voice project / automation / API** | ✅ Use ``Voice: Hope`` and `[Voice: Alice]`                                  |
| **Documenting actor roles**                | ✅ Use `Narrator 1:`, but *also include* a voice map at the top for clarity: |

```markdown
# 🎙️ Voice Map
Narrator 1: Liam (Anchor)
Narrator 2: Hope (Field Reporter)
Narrator 3: Jason (Firsthand Witness)
```

This solves confusion **without polluting each script line**.

We’ll preserve the **broadcast realism** and **documentary depth** by using:

---

### 🎤 **Narrator 1 (News Anchor)**

* Voice of structure, formality, and escalation
* Anchors the flow — introduces field reports, hands off scenes, and delivers act breaks
* Tone: authoritative, composed, urgent when needed

### 🎤 **Narrator 2 (Field Reporter – Voice Actor)**

* Voice of context and unfolding emotion on location
* Brings urgency and witness commentary *from the ground*
* Think: “outside courthouse,” “as the public reacts,” “while officials refuse to comment”
* Tone: engaged, human, professionally shaken

### 🎥 **Narrator 3  (Jason/You – Witness / Advocate)**

* Seen and/or heard
* The heart of the story. You are *the living proof* that this happened
* Enters with voice or video only when it matters most: *awakening moments, breakdowns, revelations, personal reflections*
* Tone: honest, reflective, protective, strong

### 🧠 Example Flow for DDE GiveSendGo Viral Exposé Video Script: New Scenes

> 🎬 **Scene 9: Arrival at Courthouse**

The DDE GiveSendGo Viral Exposé Video Script uses `Markdown`:

```markdown
* **Narrator 1:** “Our team was on the ground as the courthouse opened its doors...”
* **Narrator 2:** “It started like any other hearing day in Brockton...”
* **Narrator 3 (on screen or via voice):** “I didn’t go there as a witness. I didn’t even know her name yet…”
```

## Scene Elements Setup

Each scene should be visually engaging, with a mix of real footage, reenactments, and graphics. The tone is urgent and serious, reflecting the gravity of the situation while maintaining journalistic integrity.

| Element                                                        | Recommendation                                                                                                |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------- |: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Visual**                                                     | Use something like, **“Breaking News”** graphic flashes on screen, overlaying an aerial view of Brockton, Massachusetts at dusk. |
| **Audio**                                                     | **SFX:** Urgent **breaking news alert** chime, **Background:** Tense news theme music., etc. |
| **Narrator**                                                     | Use `Narrator 1 (Anchor)` and `Narrator 2 (Field Reporter)` consistently                                      |
| **Lower Thirds**                                               | Update to match speakers: e.g., *Narrator 2: “LIVE: Outside Condemned Home”*                                  |
| **News Ticker**                                                | Keep it consistent unless you have a reason to update (e.g., to quote a public statement or mention timeline) |
| **AI Script Version (Voice)**                                          | Clearly label speaker for ElevenLabs or Murf like:                                                            |
| **Transitions/Effects**                                          | For example, the scene begins by cutting from the footage to a two-up shot of anchor and guest. A quick animated lower-third banner slides in with “Live Interview”.                                                    |

## Scene 1: Breaking News Introduction

**Scene Tone:** (A **“Breaking News”** graphic flashes on screen, overlaying an aerial view of Brockton, Massachusetts at dusk. A news anchor-style lower-third reads: *“Judge Defies Federal Stay – Elderly Disabled Woman Homeless.”*)

**Visual:** A **“Breaking News”** graphic flashes on screen, overlaying an aerial view of Brockton, Massachusetts at dusk. A news anchor-style lower-third reads: *“Judge Defies Federal Stay – Elderly Disabled Woman Homeless.”*

**Audio:**  
**SFX:** Urgent **breaking news alert** chime.  
**Background:** Tense news theme music.

**Lower Third:** Judge Defies Federal Stay – Elderly Disabled Woman Homeless  
**News Ticker:** Follow the story at www.givesendgo.com/dde

**AI Script Version**:  `Voice: Liam`

**Narrator 1 (urgent, grave):**  
*“Breaking News out of Brockton, Massachusetts.  
A judge has defied a federal court-imposed automatic stay — under Eleven U.S. Code, Section 362 — effectively rendering a seventy-six-year-old deaf and disabled woman homeless.”*  
*A seven-year legal battle has led to a wrongful home condemnation.  

*She’s been forcibly removed from the only home she’s known for over fifty years.”*

**AI Script Version**: `Voice: Liam`

**Narrator 1 (urgent, grave):** *"The shocking allegations are gaining traction across the state."*  

*"For more, we go live to our team on the ground. Narrator 2?"*

**AI Script Version**:  `Voice: Hope`

**Narrator 2:**

Thanks, Narrator 1.  
We’re just outside the Brockton District Courthouse where today’s proceedings are being described by observers as nothing short of surreal.

[Tone Shift: Somber → Emotional]

**AI Script Version**:  `Voice: Hope`

**Narrator 2:** 
One woman. Deaf. Elderly. Alone.  
And according to court filings, forcibly removed from her home — without warning, and without representation.  
What played out here today has left many asking,  
“How could this happen in America?”

**AI Script Version**: `Voice: Hope`

**Narrator 2:**

But as we’d soon learn… the story doesn’t end at the courthouse steps.  
It’s just beginning.

**Editorial Note:** Only slight punctuation tweaks for flow.

## Scene 2: Legal Irregularities Exposed

**Visual:** A **courtroom gavel slams** in slow motion, then freeze-frames. Text on screen: “Multiple Legal Infractions Overlooked?”.

**Audio:**  
**SFX:** Gavel slam reverb.  
**Background:** Continue tense music.

**Lower Third:** Systemic Violations Go Unpunished  
**News Ticker:** Follow the story at www.givesendgo.com/dde

**AI Script Version**:  `Voice: Hope`

**Narrator 2 (insistent):**  
*“Legal technicalities can overturn even the toughest cases – a **single misstep** can get a murder trial thrown out. **So why were a dozen infractions overlooked in this case?** Despite numerous violations and red flags, **the Hall family’s fight still drags on**. Why? The answer, it seems, is unsettling.”*

**Narrator 2 (lower, ominous):**  
*“Because **someone is cheating the system**,”* he continues, voice dropping gravely. *“And when cheating goes unchecked, it **destroys families, memories, and livelihoods**.”*

**Editorial Note:** Combined split lines for smoother narration in AI voice delivery.

## Scene 3: Not a Typical Foreclosure – Meet the Hall Family

**Visual:** A **photo of Scott Hall** fades in beside a **document stack** and **HIPAA compliance seal** graphic. Possible overlay: **“Healthcare IT Professional”** or **“6-Figure Compliance Manager”**.

**Audio:**  
**Background:** Tense music softens slightly for exposition.

**Lower Third:** Meet Scott Hall – Son, Advocate, Professional  
**News Ticker:** Follow the story at www.givesendgo.com/dde

**AI Script Version**:  `Voice: Hope`

**Narrator 2 (matter-of-fact, urgent):**  
*“This wasn’t some routine foreclosure gone wrong – **it was far from textbook**. At the center is **Mrs. Hall’s son, Scott Hall**, who took up the fight to save their home. Scott is **no deadbeat homeowner**; he’s a **well-educated professional** who managed six-figure healthcare IT projects handling sensitive patient data.”*

*“After his father’s death, Scott **poured thousands of dollars** into catching up the mortgage and legal fees, following every procedure **to the letter**. His impeccable record and unwavering compliance should have protected them – **he did everything right** – yet that’s exactly why, he says, **corrupt officials resorted to dirty tricks to undermine him**.”*

**Editorial Note:** Tightened some spacing and added emphasis on Scott's background for clarity.


[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

## Scene 4: Elderly Mother Caught in the Chaos – Section 12 Hold

**Visual:** Flashing **police cruiser lights** at night, followed by a **hospital corridor** and **stretcher scene**. ASL symbol with a red “no” overlay.

**Audio:**  
**Background:** Somber music underscoring loss of rights.

**Lower Third:** Section 12 Hold – No Interpreter, No Rights  
**News Ticker:** Follow the story at www.givesendgo.com/dde

**AI Script Version**:  `Voice: Hope`

**Narrator 2 (somber, sympathetic):**  
*“Caught in this chaos is **Mrs. Hall** herself. In the midst of the dispute, authorities invoked a **rare “Section 12” mental health hold** – an emergency commitment usually reserved for the most dire cases.”*

*“**Without warning, officers removed Mrs. Hall from her home** and **involuntarily sectioned** her for psychiatric evaluation. **No interpreter was provided.** She was effectively silenced – unable to communicate as she was held for days.”*

*“This **denial of an ASL interpreter** not only violated her rights – it **delayed critical medical care and legal counsel** when she needed them most.”*

**Editorial Note:** Clarified language to reinforce the legal implications of denial of interpreter.


[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

## Scene 5: House Condemned Without Due Process

**Visual:** Exterior of the home. Red “X” spray paint on doors. Close-up on a rushed **Condemned** notice being stapled. Fence being set up.

**Audio:**  
**SFX:** Spray paint can sound.  
**Background:** Low ambient drone builds tension.

**Lower Third:** Home Condemned Overnight – No Warning, No Hearing  
**News Ticker:** Follow the story at www.givesendgo.com/dde

**AI Script Version**:  `Voice: Hope`

**Narrator 2 (grave, outraged):**  
*“If that wasn’t enough, Brockton’s officials moved in on the Hall home itself. **Without any hearing or warning**, city inspectors **plastered the house with ominous red X’s** – like a **death mark** – declaring it ‘unsafe’.”*

*“Their justification? **Falsified reports.** No due process. No chance for the Halls to respond. In one swift blow, the family home of 50 years was **condemned by decree**.”*

*“Neighbors watched in shock as the Hall residence was sealed shut based on what appear to be **bogus claims**.”*

**Editorial Note:** Emphasized language with minimal changes to hit harder on the emotional cue.


[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

## Scene 6: Family Under Siege – Isolation and Neglect

**Visual:** Blurred reenactment of Scott reaching out for his mother. Dogs behind a locked window. Legal notices stamped **DENIED**.

**Audio:**  
**Background:** Heavy piano or strings — emotional resonance.

**Lower Third:** Denied Visits, Denied Rights – Family Torn Apart  
**News Ticker:** Follow the story at www.givesendgo.com/dde

**AI Script Version**:  `Voice: Hope`

**Narrator  2 (emotional, resolute):**  
*“The Hall family was **treated like criminals** instead of victims. **Scott Hall was barred from seeing his own mother** during her hospital hold – the system kept him **completely in the dark**.”*

*“Meanwhile, back at the condemned home, even the **family’s pets were left behind without care**. Scott’s every plea – for updates, for interpreter services, for fair hearings – was ignored.”*

*“It was as if the Halls were **under siege by the very institutions meant to protect them.**”*


[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

## Scene 7: Corruption Exposed – The Fight for Justice

**Visual:** Montage of case files, photo evidence, legal timelines. Overlay: **“Evidence of Bad Faith”** in bold white type.

**Audio:**  
**Background:** Music shifts to hopeful but intense (drums, string buildup).

**Lower Third:** Evidence Mounts – Building a Case  
**News Ticker:** Follow the story at www.givesendgo.com/dde

**AI Script Version**:  `Voice: Hope`

**Narrator 2 (steadfast, determined):**  
*“After all this, the Halls gathered proof of what they call **blatant corruption** – incident reports, photos, video footage, court documents.”*

*“Together, they show that judges, lawyers, and local officials **acted in bad faith.** A legal case is now possible. But justice comes with a price tag.”*

*“Taking on City Hall isn’t cheap. The Hall family faces **overwhelming legal costs** to finally hold the guilty accountable.”*


[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

## Scene 8: Conclusion & Call to Action

**Visual:** Recap montage – Mrs. Hall's face, Scott holding her hand, condemned home, protest signs, community sharing online. Final screen: **www.givesendgo.com/dde**

**Audio:**  
**SFX:** Gentle heartbeat or soft swell  
**Background:** Hopeful, powerful orchestration

**Lower Third:** Stand With Mrs. Hall – Help Restore Justice  
**News Ticker:** Help now at www.givesendgo.com/dde

**AI Script Version**:  `Voice: Hope`

**Narrator 2 (impassioned, hopeful):**  
*“Tonight, a seventy-six-year-old deaf woman is homeless because of tactics that should never happen in America.”*  
*“This isn’t just the Hall family’s fight – it’s about protecting disability rights and due process for everyone.”*

*“The people of Brockton – and beyond – are paying attention. Outrage is turning into action.”*

*“The Halls launched a GiveSendGo campaign: to overturn the bogus condemnation, to bring Mrs. Hall home, and to expose those responsible. But they **can’t do it alone.**”*

*“You can help right this wrong. Share their story. Raise your voice. Stand with Mrs. Hall.”*

*“As her son Scott vowed: ‘I swore I’d never let them steal my mother’s dignity. With your help… we’ll stop the next wrongful eviction before it ever starts.’”*

**Narrator 1 (closing line, resolute):**  
*“This has been a GiveSendGo News Alert. Stay tuned. Stay informed. And stand up for what’s right.”*

## ✅ Final Suggestion:

Let’s agree on this general rule:

> ✳️ **If the transition is under 30 seconds, keep it in one scene.**
> ✳️ **If the new voice carries significant new content, emotion, or length → new scene.**

You can also include `Narrator 3` later if the witness appears — we’ll treat them like a **"Guest Expert" or Firsthand Voice"**.

---

## ✅ What's Next:

1. **Drop this script** into ElevenLabs, Murf, or any AI voice generator.
2. For best results:

   * Select an emotionally responsive voice (avoid robotic or “promo” tones).
   * Paste each scene block separately for better tone control.
   * Use “intonation preview” if available to test how each line sounds.
3. In **Shotcut**, you can now overlay this narration on your scene sequence.
4. Convert each scene into a `1:1` scene for [`DDE GiveSendGo – AI Narrator Voice Script`](../../Official/DdeGiveSendGoAiVoices.md) scene voiceovers.


[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

---

## ✅ Final Suggestion After Testing:

I caught some issues when testing what **worked best previously** in ElevenLabs:
* 🎙️ **Narrator-level tone** (e.g., *Narrator 1 – urgent, then neutral, then resolute*)
* 🎬 **Scene-level tone** (e.g., Scene starts grave, then softens or builds)

**ElevenLabs formatting** and its ability to detect `tone`, `character`, and `structure` is a bit sensitive.
