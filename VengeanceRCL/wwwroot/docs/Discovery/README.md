## **Prerequisites**

Before you can get started with the `VengeanceRCL` Project, you need to ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and configured on your system:

---

#### **Core Technologies**:

These technologies are essential for the development and execution of the `VengeanceRCL` Project. They provide the necessary frameworks, libraries, and tools to build and run the project effectively.

- [Visual Studio (v 17.14.7)](https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/tree/master/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/DocsOpenX/Technologies/#visual-studio)
- [.NET Framework (v 9.0.1)](https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/tree/master/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/DocsOpenX/Technologies/#net-framework)
- [ASP.NET Core (v 9.0.1)](https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/tree/master/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/DocsOpenX/Technologies/#aspnet-core)
- [Node.js (v 20.14.0)](https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/tree/master/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/DocsOpenX/Technologies/#node)
- [npm (v 10.8.1)](https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/tree/master/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/DocsOpenX/Technologies/#npm)

#### **Extended Use of AI**:

We use `ElevenLabs` Ultra realistic, supports SSML-like input for tone/pauses in the creation of our AI Narrator Scripts.
 
- [ElevenLabs (v 3)](https://www.elevenlabs.io)

#### **Video Editing**:

Due to Jason's dinosaur laptop, we use `Shotcut` as the quick and dirty video editor to create videos. Our current laptops can't handle the more modern editors with advanced graphics card requirements.

- [Shotcut (v 24.11.01)](https://shotcut.org/download/)
