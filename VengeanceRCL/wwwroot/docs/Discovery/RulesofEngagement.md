## **Overview**


**DDE™ (_Deaf, Disabled & Elderly_)** Discovery acts as a basic (_original_) blueprint for consistent, scalable, and maintainable creation of content and assets, including markdown documents that support most current initiatives with the `DDE`, such as the content, fundraiser and developed promotional video, as outlined in the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) section.

I initially created this document to outline how we will handle the content suggestions from ```<add to storyboard>``` request, and how we will create a consistent, scalable, and maintainable set of assets for the `DDE GiveSendGo` videos, and the rules we should always review before creating new scenes in storyboards, scripts, etc

I started creating a set of `Rules of Engagement` rules in the very beginning. Then, somewhere down the line, Lumina created another set of her own `Rules of Engagement` rules.

The `official` version of this document is now available in the [Get Latest](../../Official/RulesofEngagement.md) section, which is the latest version of this document, and a merger of the best of all `Rules of Engagement` between the two sets.

Below are the two original sets for clarity.

## ✅ **Jason's Original Rules of Engagement**


### 🧭 **DDE GiveSendGo – Rules of Engagement**:

| Area                         | Action                                                                                                                               |
|:-----------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `All Parts of the Video`   | Action-packed, viral, professional copywriting—designed to feel like a “6:00 o’clock News Alert” broadcast.                           |
| `DDE GiveSendGo Fundraiser`| Content from [givesendgo.com/dde](https://www.givesendgo.com/dde) (created with your help) can be used or adapted; once the video is final, the fundraiser page will mirror it where applicable. |
| `Shotcut`                  | We’ll use `Shotcut` for editing: video/audio cuts, background/foreground effects (blur, green screen), and final rendering.         |
| `Stock Video & Audio`      | We have access to stock footage, audio, etc.—use sparingly but strategically to make the video shine.                                  |
| `Narrators`                | Off-screen Narrators 1 (Anchor), 2 (Field Reporter) & 3 (Witness)—real or AI—so script tone, punctuation, and grammar should favor AI vocalization; real-person improv is OK if needed. |
| `Scene Expansion`          | As you add bullets, we’ll naturally expand runtime (≈5–6 minutes, or longer if needed).                                              |
| `Corruption Exposed`       | We’ve compiled timelines, reports, documents, photos & videos demonstrating bad-faith rulings—assume every scene can be backed by video proof. |

## ✅ **Lumina's Original Rules of Engagement**


### 🧭 **DDE GiveSendGo – Rules of Engagement**:

| Area                       | Action                                                                                                                               |
|: -------------------------- |: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Shotcut Asset Workflow** | We’ll stick to visual cue-based scenes. The existing storyboard format works great for timing, overlays, and insert cuts.            |
| **Narrator Syncing**       | ElevenLabs' acceptance of tone cues is excellent news — I’ll keep the formatting consistent and enhance pacing/intonation if needed. |
| **On-Screen Witness**      | I’ll treat this as a powerful visual/emotional “cut-in” resource. I’ll suggest where it could appear mid-scene to elevate impact.    |
| **Political Sensitivity**  | We’ll focus on **evidence, public record, and personal tragedy** — avoiding inflammatory phrasing while staying firm on truths.      |
| **Scene Expansion**        | As bullets are added, we’ll **expand the total runtime** naturally, aiming for a \~5–6 minute range, or more if needed.              |
| **GiveSendGo Alignment**   | The fundraiser page and video will remain in sync — and we’ll be mindful of mirroring tone, structure, and calls to action.          |

- [.NET Framework (v 9.0.1)](https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/tree/master/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/DocsOpenX/Technologies/#net-framework)
- [ASP.NET Core (v 9.0.1)](https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/tree/master/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/DocsOpenX/Technologies/#aspnet-core)

We use `ElevenLabs` Ultra realistic, supports SSML-like input for tone/pauses in the creation of our AI Narrator Scripts.
 
- [ElevenLabs (v 3)](https://www.elevenlabs.io)

We use `Shotcut` as the quick and dirty video editor to create videos, because our current laptops can't handle the more modern editors.
