## **Prerequisites**

Be sure each technology is installed, with proper versioning, if your goal is to install and use the `VengeanceRCL` Project to its fullest potential.

- [Visual Studio (v 17.14.7)](https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/tree/master/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/DocsOpenX/Technologies/#visual-studio)
- [.NET Framework (v 9.0.1)](https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/tree/master/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/DocsOpenX/Technologies/#net-framework)
- [ASP.NET Core (v 9.0.1)](https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/tree/master/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/DocsOpenX/Technologies/#aspnet-core)
- [Node.js (v 20.14.0)](https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/tree/master/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/DocsOpenX/Technologies/#node)

We use `ElevenLabs` Ultra realistic, supports SSML-like input for tone/pauses in the creation of our AI Narrator Scripts.
 
- [ElevenLabs (v 3)](https://www.elevenlabs.io)

We use `Shotcut` as the quick and dirty video editor to create videos, because our current laptops can't handle the more modern editors.

## ✅ **Storyboard Markers**

* Anything wrapped in:

  ```
  [add to storyboard]
  ... your bullet content ...
  [/add to storyboard]
  ```

  will be treated as **canon** — meaning I will:
 
  ---

  ### ✅ **Option 1: Storyboard Markers Direct**
 
 
  * 🧭 **`DDE GiveSendGo – Rules of Engagement`** → Clear principles, boundaries, and behavioral expectations for campaign contributors and participants.
  * 🎬 **`DDE GiveSendGo Viral Exposé Video Script`** → Scene-by-scene for Shotcut/video editing.
  * 🎙️ **`DDE GiveSendGo – AI Narrator Voice Script`** → Clean voiceover lines with tone for ElevenLabs and similar.
  * 💰 **`DDE GiveSendGo – Fundraiser Campaign`** → Update Fundraiaser.

### ✅ **Option 2: Storyboard Markers Loose**
  
  * Verify it against the **🧭 Rules of Engagement**.
  * Integrate it into the **🎬 storyboard scenes**.
  * Convert it into **🎙️ narrator voice lines**.
  * Fit it into the **flow and tone** we’ve already established.
  * Update 💰 **Fundraiaser to reflect** any changes within latest videos and/or story board (where applicable).

### ✅ **This also gives us full control**:

- Drop 1 line or 10 — I’ll build around it.
- You can intermix regular requests outside of those tags with no confusion.
- Helps *you* stay organized if you want to copy/paste the “storyboard-only” material later.

We can have Lumina generate *SSML* or *JSON* versions for APIs or batch uploads.

## ✅ What's Next:

1. **Drop this script** into ElevenLabs, Murf, or any AI voice generator.
2. For best results:

   * Select an emotionally responsive voice (avoid robotic or “promo” tones).
   * Paste each scene block separately for better tone control.
   * Use “intonation preview” if available to test how each line sounds.
3. In **Shotcut**, you can now overlay this narration on your scene sequence.
